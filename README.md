# Analysing-Asset-Prices-and-Returns-with-Python
In this project we considered the returns from 3 asset classes, Stock, Crypoto-currency and Bonds using Python. 

I examined stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrency prices during this and demonstrated some basic processes like pulling price data from Python and doing some basic
price analysis of equities, Bitcoin, and bond data. 

At the end of the project, I could tell with certainty the asset that had the highest ROI. This can be useful in deciding which asset class to invest in with reference to an investors risk appetite.
